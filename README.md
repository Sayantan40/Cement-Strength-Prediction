# Concrete-Strength-Prediction

# Description 
## The Compressive Strength of Concrete determines the quality of Concrete. This is generally determined by a standard crushing test on a concrete cylinder.This consumes a lot of time and requires a lot of labour to prepare different prototypes and test them. The compression strength of concrete is a measure of the concrete's ability to resist loads which tend to compress it. It is measured by crushing cylindrical concrete specimens in compression testing machine.compressive strength test, mechanical test measuring the maximum amount of compressive load a material can bear before fracturing..In this project, we are going to analyse Concrete Compressive Strength dataset and build Machine Learning models to predict the compressive strength.
